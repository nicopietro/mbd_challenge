2. Data processing: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed. All data manipulation and cleaning is done and a ML model is created and stored to be used later.
3. Backend: API is configured to communicate ML model with frontend.
4. Frontend: GUI is configured for the user to interact with the app.
5. Containerization: A set of Dockers are created to easily deploy the project on other enviroments.
